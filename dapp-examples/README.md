# =nil; DApp Examples

Welcome to **nil-dapp-examples**, a collection of example decentralized applications (DApps) built on the =nil; blockchain. This repository serves as a learning resource for developers exploring =nil; features such as contract designs, working with tokens, cross-shard messaging and more.

## Overview

This repository contains various example projects that demonstrate how to interact with =nil; smart contracts, handle asynchronous contract calls, and leverage =nil;'s unique architecture.

Each example is designed to provide hands-on experience with different aspects of =nil; and guide developers through real-world use cases.

## Examples Included

### 1. **Lending and Borrowing Protocol**

- A DeFi example showcasing how to build a lending protocol with deposits, borrowing, repayments, and interest calculations.
- Demonstrates cross-shard interactions and asynchronous contract execution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=16.x)
- Hardhat
- \=nil; testnet RPC endpoint

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/nilfoundation/nil
  cd nil/dapp-examples
  npm install
```

### Running an Example

Each example is contained in its own directory. Navigate to the example you want to run, compile the contracts, and execute the interaction scripts.

Follow the specific instructions in each example’s README.

## Things you can expect to learn:

- **Sharded Smart Contracts:** Build scalable and efficient applications.
- **Async Contract Calls:** Optimize execution flow across shards.
- **DeFi, NFTs, and More:** Explore a variety of use cases and best practices.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests with new examples or improvements. Also, please check the Issues or the README of every project where you will find `Things you can work on` , including enhancements, bug fixes, or additional features that could improve the examples. Your contributions help make this repository a better learning resource for everyone! Take a look at the Contribution Guide for additional guidelines on contributing.

By exploring these examples, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to build on =nil;. The best way to learn is by diving into the code and experimenting with different implementations!
